# personal-website
A website showing my coding capabilities within web development

## How to Run
Currently the website is not hosted (so it has to be run as a local server, or hosted somewhere to view). The easiest way to do this (if you use NodeJS and/or npm) is to use some local HTTP server. I use http-server (installed with `npm install http-server`), which runs on the current directory ("hosting" it as a local HTTP server). If you want to modify anything, you'll need to disable caching (or view the page in an "incognito" mode of your browser which does not cache pages).
